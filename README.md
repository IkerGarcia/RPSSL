Although Big Bang Theory popularized this game, it was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, so credits to them: http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html

RPSSLPi has been created by Iker Garc√≠a.

**Motivation**

Pimoroni's Explorer HAT is an awesome Raspberry Pi Add-On. While I was thinking in new projects involving the use of this HAT, it came to my mind RPSSL game. 

**Contributors**

Everyone can contribute to this project, improving the code or adding functions. I will add, in the future, a 16x2 LCD screen to show the different messages and a RGB LED matrix to shine according to the result.
